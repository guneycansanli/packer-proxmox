# Packer for Proxmox with Gitlab-ci
Build a Proxmox VM template with Hashicorp Packer, 

I use [this](https://github.com/ChristianLempa/boilerplates/tree/main/packer/proxmox) repo as a base of my Packer templates and write a blog post about it [here](https://medium.com/@saderi/create-vm-templates-on-proxmox-with-packer-84723b7e3919/).

## Requirements

- Proxmox API token with permissions to create VMs and templates
- Packer 1.7.2 or higher
- Gitlab shell executor runner with Docker installed

## How this works
Packer will create a VM from a Proxmox template, and then run a series of scripts to configure the VM. Once the scripts have completed, the VM will be shutdown and converted to a template.

## How to use
You can clone this repo and run the packer commands, or you can use the Gitlab CI/CD pipeline to build the template.

IN gitalb-ci `init` and `validate` jobs automatically run but `build` job is manual.

For variables we have two options, files or environment variables. For files you can create a `variables.json` file and pass it to packer with the `-var-file` option, or you can create a `variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl` file and packer will automatically load it.

For environment variables you can set them in your shell, or you can set them in the Gitlab CI/CD pipeline.

### Variables
| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PROXMOX_API_URL` | Proxmox API URL | Yes | |
| `PROXMOX_API_TOKEN_ID` | Proxmox API token id | Yes | |
| `PROXMOX_API_TOKEN_SECRET` | Proxmox API token secret | Yes | |
| `RUNNER_IP_ADDRESS` | IP address of the Gitlab runner | Yes | Only for build |
| `PASSWORD` | Password for user `ubuntu` | Yes | Only for build |

**Note:** about `RUNNER_IP_ADDRESS` variable: This variable is only required if you are using the Gitlab CI/CD pipeline. The reason for this is that the runner is running in Docker, and the Docker container does not have access to the Proxmox API. To get around this, we need to use the IP address of the host machine.

### Username and password
The default username for the VM is `ubuntu`. 

If you run Packer locally you must edit Packer template files and `user-data` files to set password and hashed password. If you are using the Gitlab CI/CD pipeline, just set the plaintext `PASSWORD` variable.

**Note:** You don't need hashed password on CI/CD pipeline, it will be hashed automatically. just set `PASSWORD` variable.

**Note:** You can use `openssl` command to generate hashed password. For example:
```
openssl passwd -6 -salt xyz your_password
```
